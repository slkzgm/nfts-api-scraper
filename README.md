# nfts-api-scraper
Scripts using opensea and 0xreservoir API's to retrieve the most accurate information possible about nfts collections.

This script mixes the Opensea and 0xReservoir endpoints in order to collect supply and price floor data for nfts collections.
It allows not to worry about bot protections as it uses public APIs only and therefore allows better performances than the puppeteer version.
